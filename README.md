# Architecture Sketch Auto Rendering By Conditional Generative Adversarial
MIT 6.819

In this project, we investigate conditional adversarial net- works as a potential coloring system for hand-drawn black- and-white architecture sketches. We utilize a model designed for coloring anime sketches and fine-tune it using architecture datasets. The proposed model has a generator with a U-net shape and a discriminator with an encoder- like structure. Due to the lack of paired monochrome and color architectural sketch images, we generate the required dataset from a dataset consisting of real architecture pho- tographs using photo sketching and Style transfer. We ex- periment with the model on datasets using different image processing techniques to optimize the performance. The dataset with higher resolution and color hints is a promis- ing input for photo-realistic rendering.
