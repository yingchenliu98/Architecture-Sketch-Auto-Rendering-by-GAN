# Architecture Sketch Auto Rendering By Conditional Generative Adversarial
MIT 6.819

In this project, we investigate conditional adversarial networks as a potential coloring system for hand-drawn black-and-white architecture sketches. We utilize a model designed for coloring anime sketches and fine-tune it using architecture datasets. The proposed model has a generator with a U-net shape and a discriminator with an encoder-like structure. Due to the lack of paired monochrome and color architectural sketch images, we generate the required dataset from a dataset consisting of real architecture photographs using photo sketching and Style transfer. We experiment with the model on datasets using different image processing techniques to optimize the performance. The dataset with higher resolution and color hints is a promising input for photo-realistic rendering.
